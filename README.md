This repository contains natural language processing projects.

The projects included in this repository are:

1: Chi-Square Statistic Comparison: This project entailed the investigation of the hypothises that one of the two books used in this project ( Pride and Prejudice and Du côté de chez Swann), had a greater percentage of vowels than the other.

2: Ziph's Law: In this project the primary objective was to find some empirical evidence for (or against) Ziph's Law. Zipf's law states that frequency is inversely proportional to rank. For this purpose the frequency of the word length was looked at.

3: Spell Checker: This project implements Kernighan's spelling algorithm.This spelling correction project is based on a noisy channel model.
